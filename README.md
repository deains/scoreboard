# Raspberry Pi Scoreboard app

This is a home project to create a scoreboard using [7-segment LED displays](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/large-digit-driver-hookup-guide).

The scoreboard app connects to a set of digital displays via GPIO, transmitting data serially.

A Django app also provides a web interface that can be used to set scores. Multiple web clients can be connected at the same time, and the current score will be synced with all connected clients (including the LED display, of course!).

More info coming soon on usage, installation and so on. ðŸ™‚
